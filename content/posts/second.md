## 2.1 Arithmetic Operations
At a very minimum a general-purpose computer system is required to perform the following arithmetic operations on signed integers:
- Addition
- Sign conversion
- Subtraction
- Comparison
- Multiplication
- Division 
In a very similar way to the last chapter of this project, the basic building block of addition can be used to implement all other operations. I will not go through the effort of proving this as I think its pretty obvious, and will come up in the implementation of the functions anyhow.
